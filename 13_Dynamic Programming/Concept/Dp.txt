//Notes-> 

There are two ways to solve dynamic problem:-
    1) Tabulation - Bottom Up Dynamic Programming.
        Bottom up: We start from the base case and we try to go to the required answer


    2) Memorization - Top Down Dynamic Programming.
        -In Memorization, we tend to store the value of subproblems in some map/table.
        -TOP DOWN:  avoids redundant calls done in recursion reducing time complexity   


//Trips and Tricks to solve DP problem.
 
1) Try to represent problem in terms of indexes.
2) Do all possible stuff on that indexes according to problem statement.
3) Sum of all stuffs for questions like -> count all ways.
    or min/max of all stuff for question like -> find min/max of all ways.
