searching sorting -> 
1) search in rotated sorted array. 5 (solved on 16th nov)
2) Book allocation problem. 7 (solved on 16th nov)
3) Aggressive cow problem. 9 (solved on 16th nov)

// String
4) Remove all occurences
5) All permuttion
6) string compression.

// 2D arry //10th oct
7) binSerchMtrix.
8) Rot img.

NOTE ->>//solve 2d array at least 10 problems.

circular list or not.
sort 0's 1's 2's in linkedlist.
